# Text-Generation Effect from given Text Prompt on Yelp Using DistilGPT2 Model in NLP

Abstract: The problem is to find out through generating text and finally producing new text. I used Distilled-GPT2 on a pre-trained model “bert-base-cased” to solve it. These models can, for example, fill in incomplete text or paraphrase. It can also classify and generate emotions(wav2vec2) from audio or video clip.
